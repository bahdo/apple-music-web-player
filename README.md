Apple Music Web Player so it can be enjoyed on all platforms


My friends and I love Apple Music for it's great radio stations, iTunes integration, and having exactly half of Jay Z's discography however iTunes is unavailable on Linux and constantly having it running on your phone drains the battery which is less than ideal. A friend of mine pointed out Apple has an API for Music so I hope to be finishing this at the next hackathon I attend with a very Apple-esque interface.
